# BlockFonts
BlockFonts is an addon for plugin Triton which allows using it in texts from blocks.

# Usage
First of all you have to check your installed plugins, BlockFonts depends on Triton and WorldEdit. Then you need to create text frame. Text frame is an area in which your text will be placed. 

You can create text frame using command:
```sh
/textFrame create <frame-name>
```

Make sure that you selected the region in world edit before creating.

After that you can create your language frames with some text. Than you can add this language frames into your main frame. You need to select your text using world edit and make sure that your selection maches main one. Also important that text will be placed to main frame in the same rotation as it build, it's working like world edit's copy command.

The command for it:
```sh
/textframe addLangFrame <frame-name> <language-name>
```

After this step everything will work properly, you can test it simply by changing language by Tritons command
```sh
/lang
```

So, as you can see, the usage is really simple. Feel free using this addon.
