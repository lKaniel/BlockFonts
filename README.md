# BlockFonts
BlockFonts is an addon for plugin triton which allows using Triton in texts from blocks.

# Usage
First of all you need to create text frame. Text frame is an area in which your text will be placed. 

You can create text frame using command:
```sh
/textFrame create <frame-name>
```

Make sure that you selected the region in world edit before creating.

Than you can add some language frames into your main frame. You need to select your text using world edit and make sure that your selection maches main one.

The command for it:
```sh
/textframe addLangFrame <frame-name> <language-name>
```

After this step everything will work properly, you can test it simply by changing language by Tritons command
```sh
/lang
```

So, as you can see, the usage is really simple. Feel free of using this addon.
